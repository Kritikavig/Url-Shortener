Authentication :
 statefull (uses memory of server and store the data of user)
 * when server restarts all users get log out
 * applications that do not require scalability too much.
 *Increased user increase overhead for server, to maintain state

 stateless (saves the data inside the token itself)
 * user data is stored in client side(brower)
 * we can verify its signature with orignal token
 * Easy to scale : as all data store in client side, no need to assign particular server 
 * Session data has a particular expiry data
 JWT -> store data inside payload/tokens along with id
